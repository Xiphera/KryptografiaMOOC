# CS-EJ4404-koodit

This repository defines the environment used to intialize the interactive code blocks of the course "Johdatus kryptografiaan" (CS-EJ4404). The code in the `master` branch are used automatically whenever a user activates any code block.

The python library defined in `xip.py` is used extensively during the course. It contains simple implementations of some functions used in cryptography, as well as various utilities. The directories `images` and `Tekstit` contain data used as examples during the course.

The other files are for defining the environment for interactive code. For instances, `requirements.txt` installs the library `cryptography`, which a user can then import and use in any interactive code cell.
